### Guidelines to start a run with the radiative-convective model

You have to:
 - compile the GCM and the newstart executables using the compile.sh program. You can change meridional and vertical resolutions
 - run the newstart executable (located in makestart directory) with the saturn_newstart.ref answers
 - move/copy/link the restart.nc and restartfi.nc files in saturn2d directory as start.nc and startfi.nc files
 - run the GCM with the new start files 

Easy isn't it ? :)
